## Phase 2: Train and Deploy Models

With your robot connected, record task demonstrations, build datasets, and train AI models in the cloud. Then deploy those models back to your robot for fully autonomous control.

### Step 6: Record and Create Datasets

Collect training data by recording your robot operations. These datasets will be used to train AI models for autonomous behavior.

- Switch your environment to **Live Mode**
- Turn on the camera to capture video feed
- Start recording your robot operations
- Perform the task you want the robot to learn multiple times
- Stop recording when you have enough demonstrations

<Tip>
Record 10-15 demonstrations of the same task with slight variations for better model training results.

### Step 7: Export Your Dataset

Process your recordings into structured datasets ready for training.

- Review your recorded sessions
- Trim recordings to create episodes (one per task completion)
- Select quality episodes for your dataset
- Export the dataset
- Access your dataset from the **Manage Datasets** tab

### Step 8: Train an AI Model

Use your dataset to train a machine learning model that can control your robot autonomously.

- Navigate to **AI → Training** in your environment
- Click **New Training**
- Select your exported dataset
- Choose model architecture (e.g., VLA model)
- Configure training parameters or use defaults
- Click **Start Training**
- Monitor training progress in the Training tab

```python
# Training happens in the cloud - no local setup required!
# Monitor progress in the Cyberwave dashboard
```

### Step 9: Deploy Your Model

Deploy your trained model as a controller policy to enable autonomous robot control.

- Go to **AI → Deployments** in your environment
- Click **Deploy Model**
- Select your trained model
- Give your deployment a name
- Configure deployment settings
- Click **Deploy**

### Step 10: Use AI to Control Your Robot

Control your robot autonomously using natural language prompts powered by your deployed AI model.

- Switch to **Edit Mode** in your environment
- Click **Assign Controller Policy** for your robot
- Select your deployed model
- Save the configuration
- Switch to **Live Mode**
- Enter a natural language prompt (e.g., "Pick up the object")
- Watch your robot execute the task autonomously!

<Warning>
Ensure the workspace is clear and the robot has safe operating space before running autonomous operations.
</Warning>
