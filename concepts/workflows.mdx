## What are Workflows?

Workflows in Cyberwave let you create automated sequences of robot operations. Connect nodes visually to build complex behaviors without writing procedural code.

<Info>
  Workflows run on Cyberwave's cloud infrastructure, ensuring reliable execution
  even when your local machine is offline.

## Workflow Components

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows. Each node performs a specific action:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Twin Nodes" icon="robot">
    Control digital twin position, rotation, and state
  </Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Joint Nodes" icon="gear">
  Set individual joint positions or run trajectories
</Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Condition Nodes" icon="code-branch">
  Branch based on sensor data or twin state
</Card>

  <Card title="Delay Nodes" icon="clock">
    Add timing between operations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Connections

Connections define the execution flow between nodes:

- **Sequential**: Execute nodes one after another
- **Parallel**: Execute multiple nodes simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Branch based on conditions

## Creating a Workflow

1. Navigate to **Workflows** in the dashboard
2. Click **Create Workflow**
3. Drag nodes from the palette to the canvas
4. Connect nodes by dragging from output to input ports
5. Configure each node's parameters
6. Click **Save** and **Run**

---

## Executing Workflows

Workflows can be triggered by:

- **Schedule**: Run at specific times (cron)
- **Events**: Run when sensor data matches conditions
- **API**: Trigger from external systems

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep workflows focused">
    Create separate workflows for distinct operations rather than one large
    workflow. This makes debugging and maintenance easier.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Add error handling">
  Include condition nodes to handle failure cases gracefully. Consider what
  should happen if a joint can't reach its target.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use meaningful names">
    Name nodes and workflows descriptively. "Move to inspection position" is
    better than "Node 1".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
