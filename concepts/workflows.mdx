## What are Workflows?

Workflows in Cyberwave let you create automated sequences of robot operations. Connect nodes visually to build complex behaviors without writing procedural code.

<Info>
Workflows run on Cyberwave's cloud infrastructure, ensuring reliable execution even when your local machine is offline.

## Workflow Components

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows. Each node performs a specific action:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Twin Nodes" icon="robot">
    Control digital twin position, rotation, and state
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Joint Nodes" icon="gear">
    Set individual joint positions or run trajectories
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Condition Nodes" icon="code-branch">
    Branch based on sensor data or twin state
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Delay Nodes" icon="clock">
    Add timing between operations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Connections

Connections define the execution flow between nodes:
- **Sequential**: Execute nodes one after another
- **Parallel**: Execute multiple nodes simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Branch based on conditions

## Creating a Workflow

### Using the SDK

```python
from cyberwave import Cyberwave

client = Cyberwave()

# Create a new workflow
workflow = client.api.workflow_create({
    "name": "Pick and Place",
    "description": "Move arm to pick position, grip, move to place position, release"
})

# Add nodes
pick_node = client.api.workflow_node_create(workflow.uuid, {
    "type": "joint_control",
    "config": {
        "twin_uuid": "your-twin-uuid",
        "joints": {"shoulder": 45, "elbow": 30}
    }
})

grip_node = client.api.workflow_node_create(workflow.uuid, {
    "type": "gripper",
    "config": {
        "action": "close",
        "force": 0.8
    }
})

# Connect nodes
client.api.workflow_connection_create(workflow.uuid, {
    "source_node": pick_node.uuid,
    "target_node": grip_node.uuid
})
```

### Using the Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Workflows** in the dashboard
2. Click **Create Workflow**
3. Drag nodes from the palette to the canvas
4. Connect nodes by dragging from output to input ports
5. Configure each node's parameters
6. Click **Save** and **Run**

---

## Executing Workflows

### Manual Execution

```python
# Execute a workflow
execution = client.api.workflow_execute(workflow.uuid)
print(f"Execution ID: {execution.uuid}")
print(f"Status: {execution.status}")
```

### Triggered Execution

Workflows can be triggered by:
- **Schedule**: Run at specific times (cron)
- **Events**: Run when sensor data matches conditions
- **API**: Trigger from external systems

---

## Monitoring Executions

Track workflow execution status and results:

```python
# Get execution details
execution = client.api.workflow_execution_get(execution_uuid)

print(f"Status: {execution.status}")
print(f"Started: {execution.started_at}")
print(f"Completed: {execution.completed_at}")

# Get node-level execution details
for node_execution in execution.node_executions:
    print(f"  {node_execution.node_name}: {node_execution.status}")
```

## Example: Inspection Workflow

A typical inspection workflow might include:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ Move to     │───▶│ Capture     │───▶│ Analyze     │
│ Position 1  │    │ Image       │    │ Image       │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
                                             │
                         ┌───────────────────┴───────────────────┐
                         ▼                                       ▼
                  ┌─────────────┐                         ┌─────────────┐
                  │ Pass:       │                         │ Fail:       │
                  │ Move Next   │                         │ Alert       │
                  └─────────────┘                         └─────────────┘
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep workflows focused">
    Create separate workflows for distinct operations rather than one large workflow. This makes debugging and maintenance easier.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add error handling">
    Include condition nodes to handle failure cases gracefully. Consider what should happen if a joint can't reach its target.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful names">
    Name nodes and workflows descriptively. "Move to inspection position" is better than "Node 1".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
