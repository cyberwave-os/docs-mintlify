## What is the Asset Catalog?

The Asset Catalog is Cyberwave's library of pre-configured robot assets. Each asset includes a 3D model, kinematic definition (URDF), and metadata that lets you create digital twins with a single line of code.

<Info>
  Assets in the catalog are identified by a **registry ID** in the format
  `vendor/model`, such as `the-robot-studio/so101` or `unitree/go2`.
</Info>

## Using Catalog Assets

### Create a Twin from an Asset

Use the Python SDK to create a digital twin from any catalog asset:

```python
import cyberwave as cw

# Create a twin from an asset registry ID
robot = cw.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")

# The twin is ready to use
robot.edit_position(x=1, y=0, z=0.5)
robot.edit_rotation(yaw=90)
```

The `cw.twin()` function handles everything:

- Finds the asset in the catalog
- Creates (or retrieves) a digital twin in your environment
- Returns an appropriate Twin class based on the asset's capabilities

## Asset Capabilities

Assets in the catalog have different capabilities based on their type:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Robot Arms" icon="robot-astromech">
    Joint control, inverse kinematics, gripper operations
  </Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Mobile Robots" icon="car">
  Position control, rotation, navigation
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Quadrupeds" icon="dog">
  Leg joint control, gait patterns, camera streaming
</Card>

  <Card title="Drones" icon="plane">
    Takeoff, landing, hover, flight control
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Capability-Based Twin Classes

The SDK automatically returns the right Twin class based on capabilities:

```python
# Returns GripperTwin for robot arms
arm = cw.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")
arm.joints.set("shoulder", 45)

# Returns CameraTwin for robots with cameras
dog = cw.twin("unitree/go2")
streamer = dog.start_streaming(fps=15)

# Returns FlyingTwin for drones
drone = cw.twin("dji/mini-3")
drone.takeoff(altitude=2.0)
```

## Browsing the Catalog

### Web Interface

Browse assets at [cyberwave.com/catalog](https://cyberwave.com/catalog):

- Filter by category (arms, mobile robots, quadrupeds, drones)
- Search by manufacturer or model name
- View 3D previews and specifications

### SDK Search

Search the catalog programmatically:

```python
from cyberwave import Cyberwave

client = Cyberwave()

# Search for assets
results = client.assets.search("unitree")
for asset in results:
    print(f"{asset.registry_id}: {asset.name}")
```

## Asset Structure

Each catalog asset contains:

| Component        | Description                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Registry ID**  | Unique identifier (`vendor/model`)      |
| **URDF File**    | Robot description with joints and links |
| **3D Model**     | GLB mesh for visualization              |
| **Metadata**     | Category, manufacturer, version, tags   |
| **Capabilities** | Sensors, grippers, flight, etc.         |
