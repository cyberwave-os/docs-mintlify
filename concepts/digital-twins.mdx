## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical robot that mirrors its behavior, capabilities, and environment in real-time. 
It serves as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds, enabling you to simulate, test, and optimize your robots before deploying them.

<Info>
### Key Components

- **3D Model:** Accurate geometric representation of your robot
- **Physics Simulation:** Realistic movement and interaction dynamics
- **Sensor Integration:** Virtual sensors that match your physical setup
- **Real-time Sync:** Bidirectional communication with physical robots
