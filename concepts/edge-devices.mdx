## What are Edge Devices?

Edge devices are physical computing units (like Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, or industrial PCs) that run on-site alongside your robots. They bridge the gap between your physical hardware and the Cyberwave cloud platform.

<Info>
  Edge devices run the **EdgeController** software, which receives commands from
  Cyberwave and relays them to your robots.
