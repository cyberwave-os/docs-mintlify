## Overview

Cyberwave organises resources in a simple top-down hierarchy: **Organization → Workspace → Environment**. Each level scopes access, permissions, and resource isolation so teams can collaborate without stepping on each other.

## Data Hierarchy

| Level | Contains | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Organization** | Workspaces | Your company or team, the top-level account that owns all resources |
| **Workspace** | Environments, Workflows | A shared space for a team or department to collaborate |
| **Environment** | Digital Twins, Datasets, Assets | A 3D space that mirrors your real-world robot setup |

### Organization

The top-level entity representing your company or team. All users, workspaces, and billing are managed here.

- Centralised team and member management
- Billing, subscriptions, and usage tracking
- Organization-wide settings and policies

---

### Workspace

A workspace groups related environments and workflows under a shared context, typically scoped to a team, department, or deployment stage.

- Multiple workspaces per organization
- Workspace-level member access and permissions
- Invite external collaborators by email

<Tip>
Create separate workspaces for different teams (e.g., "Research", "Production", "QA") or stages (e.g., "Development", "Staging").
</Tip>

<Info>
Use **Folders** to organise related environments within a workspace. Folders are an optional grouping mechanism; they help keep things tidy as your workspace grows.
</Info>

### Environment

An environment is a 3D virtual space that mirrors your real-world robot setup. It's where your digital twins live, sensors stream data, and controllers send commands — all in real time.

- Multiple environments per workspace
- **Edit Mode** for designing and configuring the space
- **Live Mode** for real-time operation and data streaming

**An environment contains:**

  <Card title="Simulations" icon="flask">

### Workflows

Workflows exist at the workspace level and can orchestrate operations across multiple environments.

- Visual node-based editor for building automation sequences
- Trigger-based execution — manual, scheduled, or event-driven
- Cross-environment automation capabilities

## Example

```
Organization: RoboTech Industries
└── Workspace: Research & Development
    ├── Environments:
    │   ├── "Lab Setup A"
    │   ├── "Lab Setup B"
    │   └── "Test Track"
    └── Workflows:
        ├── "Data Collection Pipeline"
        └── "Model Training Workflow"
```
