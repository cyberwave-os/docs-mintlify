### Goals

This guide walks you through connecting your physical robot to its digital twin on Cyberwave. By the end, you will have:

- Set up a virtual environment and added a digital twin of your robot
- Installed the Cyberwave edge stack on your device
- Established a real-time link between your physical hardware and the digital twin
- Assigned a controller to operate your robot and digital twin directly from the platform

<EarlyAccess />

### Step 1: Create an Environment

An **environment** is a 3D virtual space that mirrors your real-world robot setup. It's where your digital twins live, sensors stream data, and controllers send commands, all in real time.

Follow these steps to create a new environment: 
1. Go to the Cyberwave dashboard and click on **Create** -> **New Environment**. 
2. Give your environment a **name** and **description**.

### Step 2: Add Digital Twins
A digital twin is a virtual replica of your physical robot, it mirrors the robot's structure, joints, sensors, and behavior in real time within your environment.

You can add a digital twin from the Cyberwave catalog or import your own URDF file: 
1. Inside your environment, click **Add from Catalog** in the left panel.
2. Browse the catalog, find your robot's digital twin, and add it to the environment.
3. Position the twin within your environment to match your physical setup.

### Step 3: Install the Cyberwave CLI
The Cyberwave CLI is the command-line tool used to authenticate, pair, and manage your physical hardware with the Cyberwave platform.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Edge Device (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, etc.)">
    First, SSH into your edge device:

    ```bash
    ssh user@<edge-device-ip>
    ```

    Then install the CLI:

    ```bash
    # Install the CLI (one time setup)
    curl -fsSL "https://packages.buildkite.com/cyberwave/cyberwave-cli/gpgkey" | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/cyberwave_cyberwave-cli-archive-keyring.gpg

    # Configure the source
    echo -e "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cyberwave_cyberwave-cli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.buildkite.com/cyberwave/cyberwave-cli/any/ any main\ndeb-src [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cyberwave_cyberwave-cli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.buildkite.com/cyberwave/cyberwave-cli/any/ any main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buildkite-cyberwave-cyberwave-cli.list > /dev/null

    # Install the CLI
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install cyberwave-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Computer">
    Open your terminal and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Install the CLI (one time setup)
    curl -fsSL "https://packages.buildkite.com/cyberwave/cyberwave-cli/gpgkey" | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/cyberwave_cyberwave-cli-archive-keyring.gpg

    # Configure the source
    echo -e "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cyberwave_cyberwave-cli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.buildkite.com/cyberwave/cyberwave-cli/any/ any main\ndeb-src [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cyberwave_cyberwave-cli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.buildkite.com/cyberwave/cyberwave-cli/any/ any main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buildkite-cyberwave-cyberwave-cli.list > /dev/null

    # Install the CLI
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install cyberwave-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 4: Install the Edge Core

The Edge Core is the orchestrator of your Cyberwave edge components. It runs on edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, any Linux machine) and acts as the bridge between your physical hardware and the Cyberwave cloud backend.

```bash
sudo cyberwave edge install
```

The CLI will prompt you to log in with your Cyberwave credentials and then install the `cyberwave-edge-core` on your device.

---

### Step 5: Pair Hardware with Digital Twin

The CLI will walk you through pairing your physical robot with its digital twin. Follow the prompts in your terminal:

1. Select the environment you created earlier.
2. Select the digital twin you added to that environment.
3. The appropriate driver will be automatically installed and configured for your robot.
