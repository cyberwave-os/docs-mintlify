## Step 1: Create Your First Project

<EarlyAccess />

Projects help you organize your robotics work by grouping related environments, assets, and simulations together.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Click "New Project" from the dashboard
    - Give it a name like "My First Robot Project"
    - Add a description of what you're building
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Card
  title="Go to Dashboard"
  icon="folder-plus"
  href="https://cyberwave.com/dashboard"
>
  Create your first project from the dashboard
</Card>

## Step 2: Create an Environment

Environments are 3D spaces where your robots live and interact. Think of them as virtual worlds for your simulations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Click "New Environment" from your project
    - Pick a name for your environment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Step 3: Add Robot Assets

Browse our catalog of pre-built robots or upload your own URDF files to bring your robots into the simulation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Browse the asset catalog for robots
    - Add robots to your environment
    - Position and configure your robots
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4: Control with Python SDK

Take full control of your robots using our Python SDK. Write code to move robots, read sensors, and implement complex behaviors.

```python
# Install the Cyberwave SDK
pip install cyberwave

# Control your robot
import cyberwave as cw

# Connect to your robot
robot = cw.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")

# Move the robot to a position
robot.move(x=1.0, y=0.0, z=0.5)
robot.rotate(yaw=90)

# Actuate the robot's joint to 30 degrees
robot.joints.set("1", 30)
```

---

## Step 5: Record and Create Datasets

Collect training data by recording your robot operations. These datasets will be used to train AI models for autonomous behavior.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Switch your environment to **Live Mode**
    - Turn on the camera to capture video feed
    - Start recording your robot operations
    - Perform the task you want the robot to learn multiple times
    - Stop recording when you have enough demonstrations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Record 10-15 demonstrations of the same task with slight variations for better model training results.
</Tip>

---

## Step 6: Export Your Dataset

Process your recordings into structured datasets ready for training.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Review your recorded sessions
    - Trim recordings to create episodes (one per task completion)
    - Select quality episodes for your dataset
    - Export the dataset
    - Access your dataset from the **Manage Datasets** tab
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Step 7: Train an AI Model

Use your dataset to train a machine learning model that can control your robot autonomously.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Navigate to **AI → Training** in your environment
    - Click **New Training**
    - Select your exported dataset
    - Choose model architecture (e.g., VLA model)
    - Configure training parameters or use defaults
    - Click **Start Training**
    - Monitor training progress in the Training tab
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

```python
# Training happens in the cloud - no local setup required!
# Monitor progress in the Cyberwave dashboard
```

---

## Step 8: Deploy Your Model

Deploy your trained model as a controller policy to enable autonomous robot control.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Go to **AI → Deployments** in your environment
    - Click **Deploy Model**
    - Select your trained model
    - Give your deployment a name
    - Configure deployment settings
    - Click **Deploy**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Step 9: Use AI to Control Your Robot

Control your robot autonomously using natural language prompts powered by your deployed AI model.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Switch to **Edit Mode** in your environment
    - Click **Assign Controller Policy** for your robot
    - Select your deployed model
    - Save the configuration
    - Switch to **Live Mode**
    - Enter a natural language prompt (e.g., "Pick up the object")
    - Watch your robot execute the task autonomously!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Ensure the workspace is clear and the robot has safe operating space before running autonomous operations.
</Warning>
