## Key Concepts

### Workspaces

A **workspace** is your team's container for all environments, workflows, and resources. It provides centralized authentication, team collaboration, permissions, resource sharing across environments, and billing and usage tracking.

<Tip>
Use separate workspaces for different teams or deployment stages (e.g., "Development", "Testing", "Production").
</Tip>

---

### Environments

An **environment** is a 3D space where your digital twins exist and interact. It can represent physical facilities (warehouse, factory floor, outdoor space), testing scenarios, or simulation environments. Environments support both **Edit Mode** (for designing and configuring) and **Live Mode** (for real-time operation and monitoring).

---

### Digital Twins

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot that mirrors its behavior, capabilities, and state in real time. It includes an accurate 3D model, physics simulation, virtual sensors matching the physical setup, and bidirectional real-time sync with the physical robot.

---

### Edge Node

An **edge node** is a physical compute unit deployed at the periphery of the Cyberwave platform (e.g., industrial PC, embedded computer, Raspberry Pi), typically co-located with one or more robots. Edge nodes operate under strict latency, bandwidth, and reliability constraints and are designed to function even under degraded connectivity.

The edge runtime is a hybrid system: an **Edge Core** running as a host-level service for identity, authentication, and coordination, and a set of **Runtime Services** running in isolated Docker containers for modular, vendor-isolated workloads like hardware drivers and inference engines.

---

### Asset Catalog

The **Asset Catalog** is Cyberwave's library of pre-configured robot assets. Each asset includes a unique registry ID (e.g., `the-robot-studio/so101`), a URDF file describing joints and links, a 3D model for visualization, and metadata about capabilities. Asset types include robot arms, mobile robots, quadrupeds, and drones.

---

### ML Models

**ML Models** are AI models registered in your workspace that can process various inputs (video, images, audio, text, actions) and integrate with robotics workflows. Cyberwave provides an end-to-end pipeline: collect data through teleoperation, create datasets, train models, deploy as controller policies, and execute autonomously.

---

### Datasets

A **dataset** is a collection of recorded robot operations used for training ML models, containing multiple episodes with joint positions, camera feeds, and timing data.

---

### Episodes

An **episode** is a single recording of the robot completing a task from start to finish. Record 10–15 demonstrations of the same task with slight variations for better model generalisation.

---

### Workflows

**Workflows** let you create automated sequences of robot operations through visual orchestration. Connect nodes to build complex behaviors without writing procedural code. Workflows can be triggered manually, on a schedule, by events, or via the API, and run on Cyberwave's cloud infrastructure.

---

### Controller Policies

A **controller policy** determines how a robot should act. Cyberwave supports **manual control** (direct input through the dashboard or SDK), **teleoperation** (a physical leader arm controlling a follower arm in real time), **remote operation** (controlling the robot from the Cyberwave dashboard without a leader arm), and **AI models** (trained models that execute tasks from natural language prompts).

---

### Teleoperation

**Teleoperation** uses a physical leader arm to control a follower arm in real time. It requires both a leader and follower arm and is ideal for data collection and creating training datasets.

---

### Remote Operation

**Remote operation** controls the follower arm directly from the Cyberwave dashboard — only requires the follower arm. Useful for testing, calibration, and manual joint control without needing a physical leader arm.

---

### Authentication

Cyberwave uses **API keys** or **tokens** to authenticate requests for the Python SDK, REST API calls, and MQTT connections.

```bash
CYBERWAVE_API_KEY=cw_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CYBERWAVE_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
CYBERWAVE_BASE_URL=https://api.cyberwave.com
CYBERWAVE_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CYBERWAVE_WORKSPACE_ID=workspace_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure. Never commit them to version control or share them publicly.
</Warning>
