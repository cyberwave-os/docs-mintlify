## Workspaces and Projects

### Workspaces

A **workspace** is your team's container for all robotics projects, environments, and resources. It provides:
- Centralized authentication and API access
- Team collaboration and permissions
- Resource sharing across projects
- Billing and usage tracking

### Projects

**Projects** organize related robotics work within a workspace. Each project contains:
- **Environments:** 3D spaces where your robots operate
- **Twins:** Digital representations of your physical robots
- **Simulations:** Physics-based testing and validation scenarios

<Tip>
Use separate projects for different robot deployments or development stages (e.g., "Development", "Testing", "Production").
</Tip>

---

## Environments

An **environment** is a 3D space where your digital twins exist and interact. It can represent:
- Physical facilities (warehouse, factory floor, outdoor space)
- Testing scenarios
- Simulation environments

### Environment Editor

The Environment Editor allows you to:
- **Build 3D scenes** with drag-and-drop interface
- **Add digital twins** from the catalog or custom assets
- **Place sensors and cameras** for data collection
- **Export to simulation** (e.g., MuJoCo) with one click
- **Sync with real devices** for live monitoring

<Info>
Environments support both **Edit Mode** (for designing and configuring) and **Live Mode** (for real-time operation and monitoring).
</Info>

---

## Digital Twins

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot that mirrors its behavior, capabilities, and state in real-time. It serves as a bridge between physical and digital worlds.

### Key Components

- **3D Model:** Accurate geometric representation
- **Physics Simulation:** Realistic movement and dynamics
- **Sensor Integration:** Virtual sensors matching physical setup
- **Real-time Sync:** Bidirectional communication with physical robots

---

## Asset Catalog

The **Asset Catalog** is Cyberwave's library of pre-configured robot assets. Each asset includes:
- **Registry ID:** Unique identifier in `vendor/model` format (e.g., `the-robot-studio/so101`)
- **URDF File:** Robot description with joints and links
- **3D Model:** GLB mesh for visualization
- **Metadata:** Category, manufacturer, version, capabilities
- **Capabilities:** Sensors, grippers, flight control, etc.

### Asset Types

- **Robot Arms:** Joint control, inverse kinematics, gripper operations
- **Mobile Robots:** Position control, navigation
- **Quadrupeds:** Leg joint control, gait patterns, camera streaming
- **Drones:** Takeoff, landing, flight control

---

## ML Models

**ML Models** in Cyberwave are AI models registered in your workspace that can process various inputs and integrate with robotics workflows.

### Model Capabilities

Each model specifies what inputs it can process:

| Capability | Description | Use Cases |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| `can_take_video_as_input` | Process video streams | Surveillance, teleoperation |
| `can_take_image_as_input` | Process single images | Quality inspection, object detection |
| `can_take_audio_as_input` | Process audio data | Voice commands, anomaly detection |
| `can_take_text_as_input` | Process text prompts | Natural language commands (VLM) |
| `can_take_action_as_input` | Process robot actions | Behavior cloning, RL policies |

### Training and Deployment

Cyberwave provides an end-to-end ML pipeline:
1. **Collect data** through teleoperation and recording
2. **Create datasets** from recorded episodes
3. **Train models** using VLM or custom architectures
4. **Deploy models** as controller policies
5. **Execute autonomously** with natural language prompts

---

## Workflows

**Workflows** let you create automated sequences of robot operations through visual orchestration. Connect nodes to build complex behaviors without writing procedural code.

### Workflow Components


### Execution

Workflows can be triggered by:
- **Manual:** On-demand execution
- **Schedule:** Run at specific times (cron)
- **Events:** Run when sensor data matches conditions
- **API:** Trigger from external systems

<Info>
Workflows run on Cyberwave's cloud infrastructure, ensuring reliable execution even when your local machine is offline.
</Info>

## Controller Policies

A **controller policy** is a control mechanism that determines how a robot should act. Cyberwave supports multiple types of controllers:

### Types of Controllers

  <Card title="Manual Control" icon="hand">
    Direct control through dashboard or SDK
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Teleoperation" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Leader arm controls follower arm in real-time
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Remote Operation" icon="globe">
    Control from Cyberwave dashboard without leader arm
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="AI Models (VLM)" icon="brain">
    Trained models execute tasks from natural language prompts
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Assigning Controller Policies

In Edit Mode:
1. Click **Assign Controller Policy**
2. Select your deployed model or controller type
3. Save configuration
4. Switch to Live Mode to execute

## Teleoperation vs Remote Operation

### Teleoperation

**Teleoperation** uses a physical leader arm to control a follower arm:
- Requires both leader and follower arms
- Real-time joint mirroring
- Ideal for data collection and demonstrations
- Used for creating training datasets

```bash
so101-teleoperate \
    --twin-uuid YOUR_SO101_TWIN_UUID \
    --leader-port /dev/tty.usbmodem123 \
    --follower-port /dev/tty.usbmodem456 \
    --camera-twin-uuid YOUR_CAMERA_TWIN_UUID \
    --fps 30
```

### Remote Operation

**Remote operation** controls the follower arm directly from Cyberwave:
- Only requires the follower arm
- Control through dashboard interface
- Manual joint control or scripted movements
- Useful for testing and calibration

```bash
so101-remoteoperate \
    --follower-port /dev/tty.usbmodem456 \
    --twin-uuid YOUR_SO101_TWIN_UUID \
    --token YOUR_CYBERWAVE_TOKEN
```

## Datasets and Episodes

### Datasets

A **dataset** is a collection of recorded robot operations used for training ML models. Each dataset contains:
- Multiple episodes
- Joint positions and movements over time
- Camera video feeds
- Timing and sequence data

### Episodes

An **episode** is a single recording of the robot completing a task from start to finish. Episodes should:
- Demonstrate one complete task execution
- Be consistent in initial and final states
- Focus on specific behaviors
- Remove setup time and failed attempts

### Creating Datasets

1. **Record** operations during teleoperation in Live Mode
2. **Trim** recordings into discrete episodes
3. **Select** quality episodes for the dataset
4. **Export** as a structured dataset
5. **Train** ML models using the dataset

<Tip>
Record 10-15 demonstrations of the same task with slight variations to create robust datasets for better model generalization.
</Tip>

## Authentication

Cyberwave uses **API keys** or **tokens** to authenticate requests. You'll need credentials to:
- Connect the Python SDK
- Make REST API calls
- Establish MQTT connections

### Environment Variables

```bash
CYBERWAVE_API_KEY=cw_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CYBERWAVE_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
CYBERWAVE_BASE_URL=https://api.cyberwave.com
CYBERWAVE_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CYBERWAVE_WORKSPACE_ID=workspace_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure. Never commit them to version control or share them publicly.
</Warning>
