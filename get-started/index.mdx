## What is Cyberwave?

Cyberwave is an all-in-one platform that bridges the gap between **physical robots** and **digital intelligence**. It enables you to create digital twins of your robots, build and test in simulation, train AI models, and deploy autonomous behaviors; all from a unified platform accessible through your browser or SDK.

Whether you're developing a single robot arm, managing a fleet of mobile robots, or conducting cutting-edge robotics research, Cyberwave provides the tools and infrastructure you need to move faster and more confidently from concept to deployment.
