## Access Control and Sharing

### Project Sharing

Projects can be shared with specific users or made publicly accessible through links.

#### Role-Based Access

Share projects with team members using three permission levels:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Viewer** | View project, environments, and simulations (read-only) |
| **Editor** | Create and modify environments, twins, and datasets |
| **Admin** | Full control including project settings, sharing, and deletion |

**How to Share:**
1. Navigate to your project settings. 
2. Click **Share**. 
3. Add users by email. 
4. Assign appropriate role (Viewer, Editor, or Admin).
5. Send invitation.

#### Public Link Sharing

Create shareable links for broader access without requiring authentication:

**Link Types:**
- **Public Viewer Link:** Anyone with the link can view the project (read-only).
- **Public Editor Link:** Anyone with the link can edit the project.

**Use Cases:**
- Share demos with stakeholders
- Collaborate with external partners
- Create public showcases of your work

<Warning>
Public links grant access to anyone who has the link. Use public editor links cautiously and only for trusted collaborators.
</Warning>
