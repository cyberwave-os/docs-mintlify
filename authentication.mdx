## Overview

Cyberwave uses API keys or tokens to authenticate requests. You'll need credentials to:
- Connect the Python SDK
- Make REST API calls
- Establish MQTT connections

---

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Cyberwave">
    Go to [cyberwave.com](https://cyberwave.com) and sign in to your account.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to Profile">
    Click your profile icon and select **Profile** or go directly to [cyberwave.com/profile](https://cyberwave.com/profile).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    In the API Keys section, click **Generate New Key**. Copy the key immediately—it won't be shown again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure. Don't commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

### Environment Variable (Recommended)

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export CYBERWAVE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

The SDK automatically reads this variable:

```python
import cyberwave as cw

# Automatically uses CYBERWAVE_API_KEY
robot = cw.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")
```

### Direct Configuration

Pass the API key directly when initializing the client:

```python
from cyberwave import Cyberwave

client = Cyberwave(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

### Using Tokens

For short-lived sessions, you can use tokens instead of API keys:

```python
from cyberwave import Cyberwave

# Token-based authentication
client = Cyberwave(token="your_bearer_token")
```

---

## Environment Variables

The SDK supports these environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CYBERWAVE_API_KEY` | Your API key for authentication |
| `CYBERWAVE_TOKEN` | Bearer token (alternative to API key) |
| `CYBERWAVE_BASE_URL` | API base URL (default: `https://api.cyberwave.com`) |
| `CYBERWAVE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | Default environment ID |
| `CYBERWAVE_WORKSPACE_ID` | Default workspace ID |

### Example `.env` File

```bash
CYBERWAVE_API_KEY=cw_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CYBERWAVE_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Load with [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/):

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

import cyberwave as cw
robot = cw.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")
```

---

## MQTT Authentication

For real-time features (video streaming, live updates), the SDK connects to MQTT automatically using your API credentials.

```python
from cyberwave import Cyberwave

client = Cyberwave(api_key="your_api_key")

# MQTT connection uses the same credentials
robot = client.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")
robot.subscribe_joints(lambda data: print(f"Joints: {data}"))
```

### Custom MQTT Settings

Override MQTT connection settings if needed:

```python
client = Cyberwave(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    mqtt_host="mqtt.cyberwave.com",
    mqtt_port=1883
)
```

---

## REST API Authentication

For direct REST API calls, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cyberwave.com/api/assets/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication failed: Invalid or missing credentials">
    - Verify your API key is correct
    - Check that the environment variable is set: `echo $CYBERWAVE_API_KEY`
    - Ensure the key hasn't expired—generate a new one if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No CYBERWAVE_API_KEY found">
    The SDK couldn't find credentials. Either:
    - Set the `CYBERWAVE_API_KEY` environment variable
    - Pass `api_key` directly to `Cyberwave()`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="MQTT connection failed">
    - Check your network allows outbound connections on port 1883
    - Verify your API key has MQTT permissions
    - Try reconnecting: `client.mqtt.connect()`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
