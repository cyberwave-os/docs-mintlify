## Goal

This guide will help you connect the UGV Beast Rover robot to Cyberwave and control it using a keyboard controller.

---

## Architecture

The UGV Beast Rover runs on a dual-controller setup: a **Raspberry Pi** for high-level tasks like planning and perception, and an **ESP32** microcontroller for low-level motor control (motors, encoders, etc.). This design allows the Pi to focus on computation-heavy processes, while the ESP32 handles fast feedback loops.

All ROS 2 components and related libraries run inside a **Docker container** on the Raspberry Pi to ensure a consistent, isolated environment. The Pi and ESP32 communicate over a serial UART link.

To connect Cyberwave with the UGV Beast, we use an **MQTT bridge**. You’ll install a custom Cyberwave Docker image that establishes this MQTT bridge and uses the Cyberwave Python SDK to interface with the UGV Beast Rover.

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Set up the UGV Beast Rover

* Power on the robot
* Connect it to Wi-Fi or a hotspot
* SSH into the Raspberry Pi and configure access
* Identify the UGV’s IP address
* Pull the custom Cyberwave Docker image

### 2. Add the UGV Beast Twin in Cyberwave

Create an environment in Cyberwave and add a **UGV Beast twin** to it. Make sure the twin has the required capabilities configured and enabled by default.

---

## SSH into the Raspberry Pi

To access and configure the UGV Beast, you’ll first need to SSH into the Raspberry Pi.

Generate an SSH key (if you haven’t already):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Then, update your `.ssh/config` file with:

```ssh
Host EdgeUGV
    HostName 192.168.0.144      # Replace with your UGV Beast's IP
    User ws
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Replace with your SSH key path
    ForwardAgent yes
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

Connect using:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.0.144 -p 22
```

You can also use your IDE’s SSH features for easier access.

**Credentials:**

* Username: `ws`
* Password: `ws`

---

## SSH into the Docker Container

The UGV’s ROS 2 stack runs inside a Docker container. To SSH into this container, add the following entry to your `.ssh/config`:

```ssh
Host EdgeUGV-ros2-docker
    HostName 192.168.0.144
    User root
    Port 23
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ForwardAgent yes
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

Then connect via:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.0.144 -p 23
```

Or again, use your IDE for quick access.

**Docker Container Credentials:**

* Username: `root`
* Password: `ws`

---

## Configure Cyberwave Credentials in Docker

Inside the Docker container, navigate to:

```bash
cd /home/ws/ugv_ws
```

This is where the ROS workspace for the UGV Beast lives. You’ll see the `build`, `install`, `log`, and `src` folders here.

1. Open `src/mqtt_bridge/config/params.yaml` and replace the `cyberwave_token` with your actual Cyberwave API token.
2. Then go to `src/mqtt_bridge/config/mappings/robot_ugv_beast_v1.yaml` and update the `twin_uuid` to your Cyberwave UGV Beast twin ID.
3. Save both files.

---

## Rebuild the MQTT Bridge

After updating the credentials, rebuild the MQTT bridge using this script:

```bash
cd /home/ws/ugv_ws
./src/mqtt_bridge/scripts/ugv_beast/clean_build_mqtt.sh --logs
```

---

## Launch the UGV Beast Stack

To start the UGV Beast stack, run:

```bash
ros2 launch ugv_bringup master_beast.launch.py robot_id:=robot_ugv_beast_v1 debug_logs:=true
```

Change the `robot_id` if needed to match your configuration.

---

## Add the Cyberwave UGV Beast Controller

Go back to your Cyberwave environment and switch to **Live Mode** to view updates in real time.

Add a **UGV Beast controller policy** to enable keyboard control. From here, you can:

* Move the rover using keyboard input
* Turn on the onboard camera
* Record video datasets
* Interact with the robot in real time
