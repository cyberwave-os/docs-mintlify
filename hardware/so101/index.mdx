## What are SO101 Robot Arms?
SO101 is an **open-source**, **6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF)** robotic arm set designed for desk-based use. It is commonly built using 3D-printed parts and standard hardware servos, making it low-cost and highly customizable.

These robot arms expose developers to real robotic hardware without the cost or complexity of industrial systems. The SO101 arm set is often deployed as a dual-arm (leader–follower) configuration, but this setup is optional. Users can also operate a single follower arm independently. 

### Physical Components
- **6-DOF Articulated Arm**: A compact 6-DOF robotic manipulator designed for close-range, desk-based operations. 
- **Servo-Driven Joints**: Uses position-controlled servo motors to enable real-time joint movement.
- **Lightweight, Open-Source Hardware**: Built from lightweight, open-source hardware components that are easy to modify and extend. 
- **Simple End-Effector (Gripper)**: Includes a gripper suitable for basic manipulation tasks.
- **Leader-Follower Physical Setup (Optional)**: Supports a dual-arm configuration useful for teleoperation and imitation learning: 
    - **Leader arm (manually actuated)**: Joint positions are sampled.
    - **Follower arm (actively controlled)**: Mirrors the leader's joint trajectories in real time.

**Note:** The leader arm is a secondary passive arm used to capture human-guided motion. This setup is optional; you can use only the follower arm if preferred.
- **USB Control from a Computer / SBC**: The SO101 can be directly controlled from a laptop or single-board computer (SBC, such as a Raspberry Pi) over USB or serial communication. This allows developers to control the robot without industrial controllers or specialized hardware.

## Set up the SO101

Before configuring the software, you need to physically connect your SO101 hardware components.

### Connect the Hardware Components

Follow this sequence to set up your physical hardware:

#### Step 1: Power the Robot Arms

Connect both the leader and follower arms to their power supplies:

1. Locate the power input on each arm's controller board. 
2. Connect the appropriate power supply to each arm. 
3. **Verify voltage:** Ensure the voltage matches your motor specifications
   - Common configurations: 6V or 12V (depends on your motors).
   - Check your SO101 build documentation for the correct voltage. 

<Warning>
Using incorrect voltage can damage the motors or controller. Always verify the voltage specification before powering on the arms.
</Warning>

#### Step 2: Connect Arms to Computer

Each arm needs a USB connection to communicate with your computer:

1. **Leader arm:**
   - Plug one end of a USB-C cable into the leader arm's controller.
   - Plug the other end into your computer (laptop, Raspberry Pi, or SBC). 

2. **Follower arm:**
   - Plug one end of a USB-C cable into the follower arm's controller.
   - Plug the other end into your computer. 

<Note>
Each arm appears as a separate serial device. You'll identify their specific ports in the software setup steps.
</Note>

#### Step 3: Connect the Camera

If you're using an external camera for dataset recording:

1. Connect your USB camera or IP camera to the computer.
2. Verify the camera is detected by your system.

## Use Cyberwave with SO101

The SO101 robot arm set provides a low-cost and efficient way to get started with robotic manipulation. Using Cyberwave with an SO101 arm set enables the following capabilities:

- **Quick onboarding**: Onboard an SO101 arm from the Cyberwave catalog, automatically create its digital twin, and begin interacting with it in just a few clicks, no manual hardware configuration required.

- **Teleoperation**: Teleoperate the SO101 using Cyberwave's SDK, enabling real-time control of the follower arm through a physical leader arm with joint-level mirroring.

- **Remote operation**: Operate the SO101 without a leader arm by sending control commands directly from Cyberwave via the browser, SDK, or APIs.

- **Controller policies**: Assign external controller policies such as keyboard input, scripted controllers, or vision-language-action (VLA) models using a standardized control interface.

- **Create and export datasets**: Record SO101 operations, including video feeds and control actions, and automatically structure them into episodic datasets for training and evaluation.

- **Train and deploy models**: Train machine learning models using collected datasets and deploy them directly as controller policies within Cyberwave.

- **Simulation and real-world execution**: Test trained models in a browser-based 3D simulated environment using the SO101 digital twin, then deploy the same models to the physical robot without changing the logic.
