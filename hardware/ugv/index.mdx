## Goal

This guide will help you connect the UGV Beast Rover robot to Cyberwave and control it using a keyboard controller.

## What is the UGV Beast Rover? 


---

## Architecture

The UGV Beast Rover runs on a dual-controller setup: a **Raspberry Pi** for high-level tasks like planning and perception, and an **ESP32** microcontroller for low-level motor control (motors, encoders, etc.). This design allows the Pi to focus on computation-heavy processes, while the ESP32 handles fast feedback loops.

All ROS 2 components and related libraries run inside a **Docker container** on the Raspberry Pi to ensure a consistent, isolated environment. The Pi and ESP32 communicate over a serial UART link.

To connect Cyberwave with the UGV Beast, we use an **MQTT bridge**. You'll install a custom Cyberwave Docker image that establishes this MQTT bridge and uses the Cyberwave Python SDK to interface with the UGV Beast Rover.
