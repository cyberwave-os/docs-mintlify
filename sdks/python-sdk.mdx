## What is the Cyberwave Python SDK?

The Cyberwave Python SDK provides a powerful, easy-to-use interface for controlling robots, running simulations, and managing digital twins programmatically. Perfect for automation, testing, and advanced robotics applications.

## Installation

<EarlyAccess />

Install the Cyberwave Python SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install cyberwave
```

<Note>
  **Requirements:** - Python 3.11 or higher - API token (generated from your
  Profile page after getting Private Beta access)
</Note>

## Quick Start Example

Make your robot go BRRRRRRR:

```python
import cyberwave as cw

# Connect to your digital twin
robot = cw.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")

# Move the robot to a position
robot.edit_position(x=1.0, y=0.0, z=0.5)
robot.edit_rotation(yaw=90)

# Actuate the robot's joint to 30 degrees
robot.joints.set("1", 30)
```

## Stream Video

Install the additional dependencies for camera streaming:

```bash
pip install cyberwave[camera]
```

Now you can stream real time video data from your robot or sensor:

```python
from cyberwave import Cyberwave
import asyncio
import os

token = os.getenv("CYBERWAVE_TOKEN")

client = Cyberwave(
    token=token,
)

# Get or create a twin to stream to
twin_uuid = os.getenv("TWIN_UUID")

# Create camera streamer
streamer = client.video_stream(
    twin_uuid=twin_uuid,
    camera_id=0,  # Default camera (change if you have multiple cameras)
    fps=10,  # Frames per second, optional
)

try:
    await streamer.start()
    print("Stream is active. Press Ctrl+C to stop...")

    # Keep streaming until interrupted
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Stopping stream...")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during streaming: {e}")
finally:
    await streamer.stop()
    client.disconnect()
    print("Stream stopped and resources cleaned up")
```

## Authentication & Setup

Get your API token from the Cyberwave dashboard and configure authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Token">
    Go to Dashboard → Profile → API Tokens to generate your token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Environment Variable">
    Set your token as an environment variable: ```bash export
    CYBERWAVE_API_TOKEN=your_token ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Client">
    The SDK will automatically use the environment variable
  </Step>
</Steps>
