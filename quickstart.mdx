## Step 1: Create Your First Project

<EarlyAccess />

Projects help you organize your robotics work by grouping related environments, assets, and simulations together.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Click "New Project" from the dashboard - Give it a name like "My First
    Robot Project" - Add a description of what you're building
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Card

  href="https://cyberwave.com/dashboard"
>
  Create your first project from the dashboard
</Card>

## Step 2: Create an Environment

Environments are 3D spaces where your robots live and interact. Think of them as virtual worlds for your simulations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Click "New Environment" from your project - Pick a name for your
    environment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Add Robot Assets

Browse our catalog of pre-built robots or upload your own URDF files to bring your robots into the simulation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll do" icon="check-circle">
    - Browse the asset catalog for robots - Add robots to your environment -
    Position and configure your robots
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4: Control with Python SDK

Take full control of your robots using our Python SDK. Write code to move robots, read sensors, and implement complex behaviors.

```python
# Install the Cyberwave SDK
pip install cyberwave

# Control your robot
import cyberwave as cw

# Connect to your robot
robot = cw.twin("the-robot-studio/so101")

# Change the robot position and rotation
robot.edit_position(x=1.0, y=0.0, z=0.5)
robot.edit_rotation(yaw=90)

# Actuate the robot's joint to 30 degrees
robot.joints.set("1", 30)
```
