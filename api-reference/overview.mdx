## Introduction

Cyberwave provides two main APIs to interact with the platform, each designed for specific use cases and communication patterns.

## REST API

The REST API is used for **non-real-time communication** with the Cyberwave platform. It follows standard HTTP methods and is ideal for:

- Creating and managing digital twins
- Configuring robot settings
- Retrieving historical data
- Managing user accounts and permissions
- Performing administrative tasks


## MQTT API

The MQTT API is used for **real-time communication** with robots and telemetry data. This lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol is perfect for:

- Live robot control and commands
- Real-time telemetry streaming
- Sensor data collection
- Event notifications
- Low-latency bidirectional communication

## Choosing the Right API

| Use Case | Recommended API |
|----------|----------------|
| Fetch robot configuration | REST |
| Send real-time commands to robots | MQTT |
| Query historical telemetry | REST |
| Stream live sensor data | MQTT |
| Manage user permissions | REST |
| Receive instant event notifications | MQTT |

## Getting Started

To start using the Cyberwave APIs, make sure you have:

1. A valid API key or authentication credentials
2. The appropriate SDK installed (optional but recommended)
3. Network access to the Cyberwave platform
